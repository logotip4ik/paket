# Paket

Encrypt and decrypt folder and files. Only one file as output. It will eat everything, your computer
and even you...

## Repo

It should be a monorepo, currently only wip core is present.

- [`core`](./core) (wip) C++ library to encrypt and decrypt, serialize and deserialize files and
    folders. This should be used by future frontend (native app) build with nim ?

<small>This is my course project, so don't judge too strictly<small>
